Still researching, basically what I have is [the Badger 2040 W schematic](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0174/1800/files/badger_w_schematic.pdf) which I'm gonna base the main thing on, and I also have [rp2040-doom](https://github.com/kilograham/rp2040-doom) which should make it possible for me to run DOOM on my badge. Issue I'm coming across now is pins, which I definitely won't have enough of to do both, so I need to figure something out. Some sort of switch? I feel like the logical solution here is to have two Pico slots, but that seems janky and it's kind of just putting two things on the same board instead of running them on the same Pi Pico (although I'd have to reflash it anyways in order to swap between the two). Gonna do some more research, stay tuned!
